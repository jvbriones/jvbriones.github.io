# Goals

Consider these aspects when drafting your goals:

- Org and team OKRâ€™s
- What projects are coming up in the next 6 months
- What was your evaluation feedback from your last performance review, does this include your improvement areas / strength areas
- What do you envisage for your own development / career
- Where are there opportunities
- What are the deliverables in your role
- Are there any blockers or challenges that will need to be addressed
- What will you need to achieve these goals / are they realistic?
- What are the steps required for each goal
- How will you measure it / know you have achieved it
- Are they [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)?

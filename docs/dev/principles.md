# Principles

Building good software is all about **maintaining** rather than creating. Writing quality code is more about avoiding bad practices than implementing the perfect algorithm.

### EARLY FEEDBACK!

### FAIL FAST

### DRY

### INVEST

The **INVEST mnemonic** for [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development "Agile software development") projects was created by Bill Wake as a reminder of the characteristics of a good quality Product Backlog Item (commonly written in [user story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story "User story") format, but not required to be).

| letter | meaning     | description                                                                                                  |
| ------ | ----------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **I**  | Independent | The PBI should be self-contained.                                                                            |
| **N**  | Negotiable  | PBIs are not explicit contracts and should leave space for discussion.                                       |
| **V**  | Valuable    | A PBI must deliver value to the stakeholders.                                                                |
| **E**  | Estimatable | You must always be able to estimate the size of a PBI.                                                       |
| **S**  | Small       | PBIs should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize within a level of accuracy.        |
| **T**  | Testable    | The PBI or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible. |
|        |             |                                                                                                              |

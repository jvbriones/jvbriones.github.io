# Teams Self Assesment

As a part of continuous improvement initiatives, a Quality Assurance self-assessment is a process where team members evaluate their own work, processes, and performance. The main purpose of this self-assessment is to identify areas of strength and areas that need improvement to better develop actions plans.

By gaining these insights, we can better optimize resource allocation, formulate common improvement strategies, and foster a culture of self-awareness.

### Development Process**
Acceptance criteria in all business tickets and validated by the team

Technical and design decisions documented and reviewed by the team

To what extent has your team deliberately incurred technical debt in the past three months?

How often do you feel that incurring in technical debt was the right decision?

How much time did your team invest in reducing existing technical debt and maintaining your code?

Technical debt planned and addressed in the sprints (lack of tests is also technical debt)

Backlog health - tickets within a sprint, backlog size/age, amount of work in progress

Collaboration with 3d parties / other teams

Open bugs are tracked, prioritised and addressed in every sprint

Team meet the DoD before delivering

### Coding and Testing
Automated linter and checks (pre-commits) in place before pushing

Security vulnerabilities prevented

Coverage of unit/integration tests

Coverage of automated acceptance scenarios (E2E)

Trend of open bugs

Run of non functional tests - performance, load tests

Manual/Exploratory testing in pre-prod process

Sottware health dashboards in place

### CI/CD pipeline
MR/PR process, mean time to merge

Pipeline run time

Pipeline failure rate (flakiness due infra, code, tests, config)

Branches run in an isolated (or ephemeral) env

Automated unit, integration and acceptance tests (E2E) in pipelines

### Product and System
Critical user journeys are identified along its automated testing coverage

Observability and usage metrics platforms in place

Prod alerts in place

ASK SHIP 

Pair programming reduce the time to delivery¬† [https://www.eferro.net/2021/09/code-reviews-synchronous-and.html](https://www.eferro.net/2021/09/code-reviews-synchronous-and.html)

 

maybe we don't need it, but should we mention the pyramid of test and add specifics about unit vs integration / api contact vs e2e? Also is there any distinction of approach in frontend work vs backend work or across platforms (Mobile, Extension, PDapp).

If developers in your team have to repeat their asks or even worse beg ![üôè](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f64f.svg "Manos palma contra palma") for reviewing their PRs (or any other help they need), your problem is not people not prioritizing other people's work, ‚Äúlack of professionalism‚Äù or lack of ‚Äúteam player spirit‚Äù.


..lack of availability in the team as a consequence of high WIP and high utilization. The amount of begging in the system is proportional to the WIP.

**Sample 1-1 Agenda Template

|   |
|---|
|1. My wins from last week: (celebration time!)<br><br>  <br><br>2. Challenges I'm facing: (how might your manager offer coaching, advice, or remove obstacles?)<br><br>3. Feedback for me from last week: (ask your manager for general feedback and feedback related to your personal development goals, reflect on feedback you‚Äôve received or have for yourself!)<br><br>4. Feedback for my manager: (what's working well? what can be 10% better?)<br><br>  <br><br>5. My personal development: (ask your manager to hold you accountable!)<br><br>- My development focus:<br>    <br>- Progress I made last week:<br>    <br>- Small step I‚Äôll take next week:<br>    <br><br>6. Stretch question: (your manager will ask you a different question every week)|

Sample 1-1 stretch questions for managers to ask direct reports:

1. On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you with how the week went?

2. On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you with how much feedback we give each other?¬†

3. In what areas can you make an improvement that would give you the greatest return?

4. Who do you wish you could work with more? Less?

5. How do you go about prioritizing your work? How can I help?

6. What‚Äôs a recent situation you wish you handled differently? What would you change? What did you learn?

7. What could I do to make your work easier or support you better?

8. How clear do you feel about what‚Äôs expected of you, your tasks, and your role?

9. How would you rate your satisfaction with your decision-making power and amount of direction you get?

10. How happy are you with the amount of impact you are having internally? How about clients?

11. How would you rate your feeling of progress in your work? How about your personal development?

12. How connected do you feel to the team? What can make you feel more connected or included?**

QA engineers are both enablers and supporters

  
  
  

minimal test:

given this

when this happens

then that should be the outcome

  
  

look for all the things that are getting in the way for me to release something today

  

integration times and team boundaries

  

One of the tools that drives high quality, is the ability to obtain reliable test results quickly, and fo that we need to avoid test flakiness, the code should be testable, and for that it should meet certain propieties, modular, cohesive etc..

  

Flaky tests also tell you something -> most of the times are flaky environments or race prod code conditions

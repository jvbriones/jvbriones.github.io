# Agile SDLC

Testing has an impact on software architecture, which in turn has an impact on the org structure and teams collaboration. The way teams work is directly related to the final quality of the product.

### What is the goal of an agile SDLC approach?

Iterate based on **early feedback** and **continuous improvement** to deliver **working software**.

### How do you estimate the work to be done?

- If points used -> only for working software tickets and depending on the complexity. Fibonacci.
- If no estimates -> tickets same size. Speed is the number of working software tickets done.

### What to do for issues that were not possible to finish within a sprint?

Close current ticket with the adjusted achieved points and clone a new one with the difference of the points (if is the case).
  
### How to handle a story with both back and frontend? same ticket?

Ideally the story has both back and front, like a vertical slide, to deliver a total working software piece of the product but it depend on the team/system context.

#### What if only the backend bit gets finished in the sprint?

Depending on the acceptance criteria, but normally it should not be considered done and would be carry over to the next sprint.
  
### Are subtasks estimated? how?

They should not be estimated, they are intended to be auxiliar items to track better the parent ticket.
  
### How to describe good tickets?

- INVEST principle: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.
- Acceptance criteria in Gherkin language

### If you had to only keep a team sync meeting ceremony, which one would be?

Retrospective.
